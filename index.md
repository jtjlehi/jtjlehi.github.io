Welcome to my blog.

Don't expect to much from it. Especially in the way of grammer.

I'm currently working full time writing Rust, Haskell, and Cuda kernels. I also do a lot of programming in my spare time (mostly in the languages listed above).

If you are interested in a job writing Rust or Haskell, send me an email with your resume.
